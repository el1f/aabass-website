I attended the So You Can Longboard Dance (SYCLD) 2023 event in the Netherlands this year as well. Last year was a blast and I was really looking forward to repeat the experience again this year. _This time it was an absolutely terrible though_. I'm just going to lay down the reasons for that in this little post now, for no other reason than to get it off my chest and understand how I can make the best of the experience when I inevitably try again next year.

### Reason 1: Terrible planning
These past months were incredibly chaotic, so many projects have seen the light of day, so many other have started only to then get thrown away, even more are stuck in this weird limbo of fighting to see the light of day to never actually succeed in coming through. I've been making plans to shift many of my foundations, from planning to phisically move to another country, 

export default ({ thought: { meta, toc }, children }) => {
	return (
		<ThoughtsLayout
			header={{
				category: meta.category,
				cover: meta.cover,
				isLive: meta.isLive,
				publishedAt: meta.date,
				readingTime: meta.readingTime,
				tags: meta.tags,
				title: meta.title,
			}}
			seo={{
				description: meta.description,
				ogDescription: meta.description,
				ogImage: meta.cover,
				ogTitle: meta.title,
				ogType: "article",
				title: meta.title,
				twitterHandle: meta.authorHandle,
				url: `https://ayoub.aabass.net/thoughts/${meta.title}`,
			}}
			toc={meta.hasToc ? toc : undefined}
			isWrapped
		>
			{children}
		</ThoughtsLayout>
	);
};

export const getStaticProps = async ({ locale }) => {
	const thought = getThoughtMeta("sycld-2023");
	return {
		props: {
			...(await serverSideTranslations(locale ?? "en", [
				"common",
				"changelog",
			])),
			thought,
		},
	};
};
