It's been a long time since the last time I wrote something aimed at being read by someone else. There's been plenty of reading in these past years of mine. Be it reading some incredible stories born from the fantasy of the most creative minds of our time, books from guys teaching me how to face my daily challenges, technical articles from fellow developers walking me through new and exciting technology or solutions to the many problems I face during my daily development activities.

_I've always been kind of jealous of that ability._

To me, it always felt like the sheer amount of prowess needed to organize your thoughts comprehensively, to communicate and teach your peers about the topics you are knowledgeable about. It feels more akin to wizardry and talent than a skill someone like me can hone through trial and error. But come on, **how silly is that**?

There is no such thing as magic in this world, nor any skill that's completely unattainable given enough time and practice. The truth is that I've always felt a little scared when it came to putting myself out there for anyone who came around finding my writing to be able to scrutinize me and find flaws in it, extending it to my thought process, to my expertise and then to me as a professional and as a person.

Growing up I'm starting to realize more and more what my shortcomings are as an individual, realizing that many of them come from the lack of belief in myself and my value both in the personal sphere and in my working relationships.
It's terrifying when you start realizing the amount of damage that can be dealt by some mishaps in one's career and experience.

## Getting over it

Going forward in life I've decided it's time to take a lot of these aspects way more seriously and to actively fight the urge to hide my flaws, opting to wear them on my belt instead. Slowly chipping away at my ambitions while leaving very obvious breadcrumbs across my path to allow me to look back and see how far I've come. These first articles, no, these first **thoughts** are going to be exactly that. Most of these aren't here to win any prizes as amazing pieces of writing, they are more of a personal gym to start getting comfortable with maying down my ideas bare and to help me gather feedback on how to improve my ability to express them. Spacing from the more technical space to how I felt about the last coffee place I found out about to what kind of emotions the last exhibitions I've been to have sparked in me.
I hope you'll have fun following me through this journey!
