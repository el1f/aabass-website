I was born in <strong>Morocco</strong> but I've lived most of my Life in <strong>Italy</strong> after moving there with my family when I was around 3. Still can't get over that first snowy december day, it was magical!<br /><hr />I'm now 25 years old and I'm currently living in <strong>Padua</strong> where I'm working as a <strong>Freelance</strong> developer and designer. I've mostly worked in startups and small companies, dabbling with the occasional bigger reality when the opportunity arose but I definitely think I thrive in smaller environments where I can be more hands-on with all aspects of the products I'm working on.<br /><hr />I'm a fairly adventurous person, I love <strong>traveling</strong>, <strong>extreme sports</strong> and anything that allows me to live life to the fullest. I'm also a huge <strong>foodie</strong> and I love trying out new restaurants and cuisines.<br /><hr />I've also been getting deeper and deeper into the weird Coffee rabbit hole and I've spent the past year honing my home barista game. I've been dedicating a lot of my free time to Longboard dancing and freeride ever since the start of the pandemic and I'm involved with several projects in that field as well.",
