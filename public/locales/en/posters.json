I love to design posters and other printed media in my free time to experiment with the latest design trends and try out compositions and techniques that I wouldn't be able to use in my day-to-day work.</br>This is a collection of my favorite posters that I have designed over the past months, including some of my first experiments with print design. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!"
